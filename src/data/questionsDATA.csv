6,What is the main direct objective of conducting software reviews?,medium,To improve team communication and collaboration,to detect defects early in software artifacts,To reduce development costs in later project phases,To train developers in organizational standards ,B
7,Which statement best describes a plan-driven development method?,easy,Planning is done incrementally and requirements change frequently,development is based mainly on rapid prototyping ,all development  phases are planned in advance and progress is measured against the plan ,the system is built entirely from reusable components,C
8,what is the main difference between vaildation testing and defect testing?,medium,validation testing focuses in system performance while defect testing focuses on usability,validation testing checks whether the software meets user requirements  while defect testing aims to expose faults,validation testing is performed only after release while defect testing is done during development,validation testing is a static technique while defect testing is a dynamic technique,B
9,Which statement correctly describes the relationship between system testing and release testing?,hard,release testing replaces system testing and is performed only by developers ,system testing and release testing have the same objectives and are performed by the same team,release testing is a form of system testing focused on validation and is usually conducted by an indepndent team,system testing focuses on validation while relase testing focuses only on defect detection,C
10,An organization is maintaining a legacy system that has high business value but low system quality. According to software maintenance and evolution principles  which strategy is most appropriate in this situation?,hard,scrap the system completely and redesign business processes,continue normal corrective maintenance without structural changes,Re-enginner the system to improve maintainability while preserving functionality ,replace the system immediately with a new-off-the-shelf solution,C

12,What is the main benefit of the Observer design pattern?,expert,It improves execution speed,It reduces memory usage,It allows objects to be notified automatically when another object changes state,It prevents runtime errors,C
13,Which of the following best distinguishes product standards from process standards?,medium,Product standards focus on management  process standards focus on coding,Product standards define software characteristics  process standards define how development is performed,Product standards apply only to testing  process standards apply only to design,There is no difference between them,B
